Hey there,

As of January 2024 I am a PHD-student at DAMS-Lab @ TU-Berlin. 

Having a background in biology(B.Sc.) and bioinformatics(M.Sc.), my research interest is interdisciplinary work in the fields of medicine and computer science,
using machine learning approaches to tackle challenges in healthcare.

Im currently part of the LungCAIRE project of Bifold-Institute Berlin.
